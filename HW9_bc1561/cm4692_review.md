# Plot Review for Ma Cheng (cm4692)

![Alt text](cm4692_plot.jpg)

**Figure 1:** Changing of the number of Seattle's bicycle trips ( from west and east sidewalks and sum them up) as time goes from 2013-2015

West line shows the number change of the west sidewalk.
Orange line shows the number change of the east sidewalk.
Green line shows the total number change tendency.
The plot directly shows that the citizens of Seattle are more active in summer than in winter.
What's more, more people choose bicycle as the tool for movement with year increases.
And the people in west sidewalk are more active than who in east sidewalk

# Comments:
__CLARITY:__ The Plot is very clear in what it's presenting with legible x,y axis labels and corresponding legend for the lines. However, there are confusions, the plot shows weekly trips on the y axis but the x ticks intervals are by month.

__AESTHETIC:__ The plot is very simple and straight forward in it's representation, however, in terms of color choices, maybe the plotter can pick a different shade of blue or green to provide more accessibility. To better make a point, the plotter can consider drawing transparent vertical bars to include summer periods.

__HONESTY:__ The plot is not misleading, however, the difference between east and west line plots is not explained.

# FBB feedback

Weekly trip is not ambiguous with the montly x-axis: there are 24 time stamps bewteen January and July, corrisponding to the ~24 weeks in 6 months. The ticks on the x axis are monthly, but there is no need to have ticks aligned with the sampling of a time series.

The glaring esthetic issue with this plot (as it is shown in your repo at least) is the low resolution which is distracting, and off-putting. 

The clarity is impaired by the redundancy: why is total and westward and eastward shown, while westward and eastward have negligeable differences that are almost certainly not significant, so total os just 2 x east or 2 x west? 

The  y axis label is ambiguous: what is the quantity being plotted? "Number of treeps per week"

The title does not need to say that this is a plot "Plot of Seattle weekly bicycle trips" -> "Seattle PRONTO bike usage September 2013- June 2015" (here yes you could use the dates, cause they are not clear from the plot, in fact using the exact data , e.g. 10/6/2015, would be very useful

ok though. 

10/10
